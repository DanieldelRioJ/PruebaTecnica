<a id="execute"></a>
## 1. How to execute
With node and npm properly installed, you can install the packages needed to compile the project using the following command:
```
npm install
```
Once installed, you can execute the code with:
```
ng serve
```
But if you want to compile it in order to deploy in a WebServer like Apache Tomcat or nginx, the command needed is:
```
ng build
```

<a id="api-key"></a>
## 2. How to get API KEY
You can make the webpage working properly without the api server (using mocked data) by changing the variable ```environment.USE_MOCK_DATA = true```.  
In order to get the API KEY needed to execute the WebPage with real data, you need to register in [VisualCrossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services), this key must be passed in the Login prompt in our page.

## 3. Features
<a id="languages"></a>
### 3.1. Languages
You can use the web in different languages, specifically:

- Spanish
- English
- Catalan
- Galician
- Euskera
- French
- Portuguese

I would like to highlight that locale dates are showed depending on Lang used (```dd/MM/yyyy``` when ```'es'```, ```MM/dd/yyyy``` when ```'en'```)
By default, the language used is the once of the browser or the last selected by the user.

### 3.2. Dark mode
You can change between dark and light mode depending on what you prefer.
By default, the mode used is the same of the system.
